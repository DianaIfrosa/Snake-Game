# Snake Game
Snake game developed within the "Introduction to Robotics" course, 3rd year, 1st semester

## Introduction 
&ensp; This project consists of an extended snake game along with an intuitive menu designed to customize the playing session after user's preferences and, at the same time, to facilitate the user's experience. I have chosen to develop this game because I wanted to make the classic snake game more fun and interesting. With that in mind, I have created 2 more ways to play the game, one more difficult than the other, based on the classic game.   
&ensp; The whole project was a challenge, not only because I wanted to improve the existing snake game, but also since it was my first time developing something this big that combines hardware and software.
